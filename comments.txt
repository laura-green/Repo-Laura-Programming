2016.09.26 - Nice work laura! Most people made the same mistakes on HW2, so
go back to the corrections to see what I was looking for. Also, if you do not
have time to do a homework you can always submit a blank .R file, which counts
for completion. I encourage you to go back and look at HW3 though,as functions
are important and sometimes difficult! Overall your participation in class
is great, so keep it up!

2016.10.25 - HW5 - Nice work laura, hope the tests went well. Have a nice
             break!

2016.11.05 - HW7 and HW8 - Great work on HW7, I'm glad you found the assignment
             so interesting. It looks like you got a chance to look at some
             tools online and learned the lesson of commenting your code as
             you go, as when you come back several days later things were
             unclear!
