# I am using my own data.

# QUESTION 1 Load your csv file.

getwd()
setwd(dir = '~/GitHub/RepoLauraProgramming/Session7')
my_data <- read.csv('MyData7.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\"", dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "")

my_data

# QUESTION 2 

# No time right now to go through/understand/replicate Week 8 stuff...

# I did work a lot on week 7 HW though. 
# See you in class!
